# osu-spectate
a configurable osu! spectator client

this program is designed as a proof of concept for a customizeable osu! tournament streaming client.
end goal:

program will serve as a client, and a server (two modes, choose one on startup).

the server can select replays, and record audio(commentary), streaming both to the client.

the client can display these in an arrangement of views.

live spectating people playing in the official osu! client is NOT one of the goals at the moment.

views can have different information in them, such as the actual cursor and circles of the gameplay, or live updating 300,100,50,miss counts.

additional ideas and possible future avenues:

built in twitch streaming

built in video export (that doesn't require a powerful computer, and just takes longer if you have a bad computer)

list of live events

multiple different voice streams (grouped into parts) so you could have commentary in different languages, or mute one specific commentator in that language

idk, prob some other stuff too...
